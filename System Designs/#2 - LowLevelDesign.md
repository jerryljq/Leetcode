# Low Level Design
## Overall
### Digs deeper into High Level Design.
### How individual system/sub-system is implemented.
### Optimizations within sub-system.

## Examples
- Design a parking lot
- Pricing System in Design Uber

## Expectations
### Requirements
- Functional
- Non-Functional
- Clean Code

### Futuristic

## Approaches
1. Gather requirements (Functional and non-functional)
2. Code: Define interfaces (REST standard/APIs that are easy to integrate), class hierarchy and DB Entities
3. Know about design patterns
4. Quality: Basic tests, Modular (easy to extend), Testable
